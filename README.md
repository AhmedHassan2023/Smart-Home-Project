# Smart-Home-Project-AVR
This ia a smart home project using atmeg32 microcontroller.
In this project i used two microcontrollers and made communication between them using spi protocol and the project is based on layerd architcture, in this project there is :
  1- temprature sensor,
  2- ldr Sensor,
  3- Servo motor,
  4- buzzer,
  5- lcd,
  6- SSD,
  7- keypad,
  8- leds.
In this project i used many prephirals in avr microcontrolles like : dio, adc, spi, timers.
